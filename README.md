# docker-phlat
dockerization of phlat 
- branch/tag "with_index" is very large and includes ~3.5Gb bowtie index
- branch master/tag latest = slim version that assumes you've stored the index somewhere local already

NOTE: you need your own `phlat-release/` folder which can be acquired through https://sites.google.com/site/projectphlat/Downloads
